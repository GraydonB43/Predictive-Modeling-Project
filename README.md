# Predictive-Modeling-Project
The goal of this project was to minimize the prediction error measured by RMSE while still making sure overfitting of the data on the original training data set was not occuring.

PredictiveModelingProjectData = the original data provided on the y, x1 and x2 variables

TestData = new data to apply model to in order to generate predictions for what y should be given certain values for x1 and x2

Predictive Modeling Project Code = code used in order to train and test various models on the original data in order to identify the most accurate model that reduces
the RMSE while not overfitting the training dataset. Also includes code used to test the proposed model on the data contained in TestData.csv.

TestDataPredictions = the predictions obtained from testing the model identified in the predictive modeling code against the data contained in the TestData.csv file
